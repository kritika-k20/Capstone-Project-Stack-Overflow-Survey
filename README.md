Stack Overflow Survey

Stack Overflow, the go-to platform for developers, conducted a global survey to capture insights into the developer community. This survey includes various questions related to professional experience, coding activities, tools, technologies, and preferences. The dataset offers important information about the current state of software development worldwide.

The dataset is available as part of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey under an Open Database License (ODbL).

In this project, we will work with a subset of the original dataset to explore, analyze, and visualize various trends. 
The survey data consists of responses from developers with different professional backgrounds, educational levels and geographic locations. 
This project aims to gain insights into the most popular programming languages, platforms, and frameworks, as well as the challenges and opportunities facing developers today by exploring the survey data.

Technologies Used:
Excel, Python, SQL, Cognos Analytics, Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Methodologies Used:
Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Dashboards

What this Analysis tells us:
The analysis helped us understand the key trends in the market interest for technology usage.​
We can conclude that there's a small shift towards more cloud based, user friendly technologies.​
Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot and AWS are leading in both current usage and future trends.​
The demographics leans towards most developers being aged 25-34 years old (41.3%), most respondents are from USA and most of them have a Bachelor's or Master's degree.​
It helps the developers and educators by leading them to upskill and  offer trainings for new emerging technologies and move away from traditional programs.​
